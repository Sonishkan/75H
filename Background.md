# 75 Hard

## Background

The 75 Hard Challenge was created in 2019 by entrepreneur Andy Frisella, a podcaster and CEO of the supplement company 1st Phorm. 75 Hard is not a fitness challenge, but a “transformative mental toughness program,” according to the program’s website.

## Rules
For 75 consecutive days, 75 Hard participants must do the following every day, according to the program’s welcome email:

Follow a diet. While it can be a diet of your choosing, the diet must be a structured eating plan with the goal of physical improvement. No alcohol or meals outside your chosen diet are allowed.
Complete two 45-minute workouts, one of which must be outdoors.
Take a progress picture.
Drink 1 gallon of water.
Read 10 pages of a book (audiobooks not included).

## Benifits

The 75 Hard program claims to improve your:
- Confidence
- Self-esteem
- Perseverance
- Self-worth
- Self-belief
- Fortitude
- Grittiness
- Discipline

## Why this project
I'm creating this project for me to not only gain technical skills but also to go through the 75 Hard program. It is all about self-improvement and growth. I've learnt a few things during my internship at LSEG and I want to put that to use and learn more.

## Outcome
The outcome of this is to have a personal 75 Hard login for all members that may join. Using react js and then deploying this on the cloud for all users to use. There will be a learderboard that says how many times someone has completed it, and how far they are in the 75 days. It will be a very simple site. Users login to tickoff all the rules they have completed and can check the leaderboard. Maybe use AI api to give them words of encouragement.
